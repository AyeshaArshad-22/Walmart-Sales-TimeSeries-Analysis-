# 🛒 Time Series Analysis of Walmart Sales Data

This project focuses on analyzing **Walmart retail sales data** using Python.  
The goal is to understand sales trends, apply smoothing techniques, and visualize performance over time.  
It is a part of my internship learning tasks.

## 📊 Project Overview
In this notebook, I worked on:
- 📥 Loading and preprocessing the dataset (`train.csv`)
- 🔍 Exploring the data structure and basic statistics
- 📆 Resampling weekly sales data into **monthly frequency**
- 📉 Visualizing **sales trends** over time
- 📈 Applying **Moving Averages (3-month)** for trend smoothing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning, resampling, manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** → Trend visualization and plotting

## 📈 Key Insights
- Monthly sales trends help identify growth and decline periods  
- Moving Averages smooth out random fluctuations in data  
- Visualizations highlight both short-term and long-term sales behavior
